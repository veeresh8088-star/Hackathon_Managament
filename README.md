OpenHack: A distributed enterprise application is basically a hackathon management service designed specifically to 
create and organize hackathons for those people who are seeking out to enhance their coding skills on a higher level 
and of course to enhance their creativity. The hackathons are managed by admin who will create and organize hackathons 
and allow hackers to participate in them in the form of a team. A team will have a minimum and maximum number of team 
members who all will register and pay a fees and only after successful payment, they would be able to participate in the 
Hackathon and submit their code. Once a hackathon has been closed for submissions, the code evaluations will be done by 
judges who will assign a grade to each team. The judge can be any user who is not himself a participant of the same 
hackathon he is supposed to evaluate. Additionally, a user can create his own organization on OpenHack which can be 
joined by other people. These organizations can sponsor Hackathons as well.
